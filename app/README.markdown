Hi. Thanks for the challenge; it was fun.

I used images (i.e. the header) where the mockup had words, and I used css where it had images (i.e. the clickable boxes' shading). If the intention is to have the title animated or something like that, this would change. (I do realize that I don't have any h1 tags; if this was the real deal I'd use the blank header and add the words on top.)

So much JS was used! Then I reread the instructions and it said to do it without. That would entail just html and css, basically one massively long document with a lot of show and hide css in it. 

IE doesn't show background gradients, so I used grey boxes instead. 

Thanks,
Kris
